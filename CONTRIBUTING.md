# Contributing

Our goal is to have mostly projects that are stable and useful to many users.

## Submission Guidelines

- For submitting new tools:
  - We recommend you to prepare and complete the tool's documentation first as we prefer to include all relevant information and official links inline in the index page (README.md).
  - Add your tool relevant information to the index page (README.md).
  - If you would like to include and link to an image, you can add it under the [`img` folder](./img/), and include it in the same pull request
  - Create a pull request with the changes against the `main` branch
- For editing existing tracked tools:
  - Create a pull request directly with the changes needed against the `main` branch

_ðŸ’¡Note_: The `details` folder consists of each tool's information that we have collected to summarize useful features and resources for the audience. However, this act stems from the lack of documentation from that tool. Therefore, we encourage new and existing project owners to complete the documentation and any relevant materials so that we can redirect other users to those information directly in the index file. However, please feel free to make a PR to update incorrect or outdated information in the `details` folder as it still provides valuable insights in the mean time.

## Removing projects

We don't remove projects unless they are outright broken or pronounced deprecated by another project or by its author.
